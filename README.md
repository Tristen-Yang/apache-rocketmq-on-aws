# Apache RocketMQ on the AWS Cloud

[中文](./README.zh.md)

This solution provides a one click cloudformation deployment to sets up a high available Apache RocketMQ cluster on AWS environment.

Apache RocketMQ is a unified messaging engine as well as lightweight data processing platform. The RocketMQ on AWS solution enables customers to quickly deploy a RocketMQ cluster in AWS Cloud. The basic cluster settings such as EC2 instance types are also configurable during the deployment.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying Apache RocketMQ into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying Apache RocketMQ into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
